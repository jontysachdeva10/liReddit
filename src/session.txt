req.session.userId = user.id;

{ userId: 1 } -> send it to Redis

Redis is a key-value store, we will use key to fetch the object.
Key might look like... 

1.
Storing in Redis
sess:gyh15uiqweb -> { userId: 1 }

2.
Express-session will set a ENCRYPTED VERSION OF THE KEY as a cookie on my browser, say q78sdcfsdrf7we4we

3.
When user makes the request, q78sdcfsdrf7we4we -> will be sent to server

4.
On the server, q78sdcfsdrf7we4we is DECRYPTED using the secret 'qwertyuiop' mentioned in ~index.ts
q78sdcfsdrf7we4we -> sess:gyh15uiqweb

5. 
Make a request to Redis
sess:gyh15uiqweb -> { userId: 1 }

6.
Store { userId: 1 } -> req.session
